# hip-hop-sampler-with-tone-js

Making a hip hop sampler with [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for free-style rap performance.

All the track sounds were coded by using `tone.js` and `JavaScript`. No sample is used except the scratch sound and crowd noise.

## Sampler

[Go to the sampler](https://mydatahack.github.io/tonejs-sampler-1/)

It starts with a basic drum beat and you can toggle other parts in and out. Clicking the record on the right will make scratch noise. Confetti button is magic ðŸ¦„'ðŸ¦„'ðŸ¦„'

In addition to `tone.js`, we are using [fireworks.js](https://fireworks.js.org/) for the fireworks effect and [js-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-confetti) for generating emoji confettiðŸ¥³
